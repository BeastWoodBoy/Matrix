# Matrix
Built a matrix class because I was tired of using all these garbage tools online that make it hard to preform most operations at the same time. Project primarily as a quick way to do simple operations on Matricies

In Future I hope to add RREF and eigen space functionality

Current Features:
- Determinant
- Tranpose
- Trace
- Matrix Multiplication
- Matrix Addition
- Cofactor
- Adjoint
- Inverse
- And a few other helper methods to make everything as readable as possible

Recently Added:
- Cofactor
- Adjoint
- Inverse
- Command Line functionality (In Progress)
